This little program is used to figure out the cost of commuting by car. It is slightly incomplete as I wish to include the a cost comparison and graphics to bicycling. However the point of one-shots is that they're quick and dirty, only to be small experiments. Likely the complete version of this program will be posted on my [blog](https://blog.kinnaman.net) once it's fully fleshed out.
